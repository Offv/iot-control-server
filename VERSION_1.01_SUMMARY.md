# Version 1.01 Summary - IoT Control Server

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

**Date**: August 1, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **STABLE RELEASE - PRODUCTION READY**

## 📋 What We Achieved

### 1. **Complete System Synchronization**
- ✅ Development PC and Raspberry Pi deployment are now **100% in sync**
- ✅ All code changes, configurations, and documentation are identical
- ✅ Git repository contains the complete, working system
- ✅ Version 1.01 tag marks this stable release

### 2. **Critical MQTT Connection Fix**
- ✅ **Resolved persistent MQTT connection failures**
- ✅ Moved MQTT connection to startup event to avoid Docker networking timing issues
- ✅ Eliminated `[Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution` errors
- ✅ Backend now successfully connects to MQTT broker and publishes temperature data

### 3. **Fresh Docker Installation**
- ✅ **Complete Docker reinstallation** resolved all persistent issues
- ✅ Eliminated `ContainerConfig` errors and build cache problems
- ✅ All containers now build and run correctly
- ✅ No more file synchronization issues

### 4. **Production System Verification**
- ✅ **MQTT Communication**: Working perfectly - temperature data publishing and subscription
- ✅ **Backend API**: Responding correctly on port 38002
- ✅ **Frontend Interface**: Accessible and functional
- ✅ **IO-Link Integration**: Reliable sensor data polling
- ✅ **Dual Heater Control**: Complete HTR-A and HTR-B management
- ✅ **State Persistence**: All UI parameters maintained across sessions

## 🔧 Technical Resolution Summary

### The Root Cause
The persistent communication issues were caused by **Docker networking timing problems** where the MQTT client was attempting to connect before the Docker network was fully established.

### The Solution
1. **Moved MQTT connection logic** from global scope to the `startup_event` function
2. **Complete Docker reinstallation** to eliminate corrupted cache and configuration
3. **Fresh code deployment** from Git to ensure no cached files

### The Result
- **MQTT Connection**: ✅ Working
- **Temperature Updates**: ✅ Real-time
- **Frontend Communication**: ✅ Functional
- **Docker Stability**: ✅ Reliable
